# Ecommerce Sales Dashboard

## Overview
This is the first Power BI dashboard I created, designed to visualize ecommerce sales data. The dashboard provides insights into total amount, profit, quantity, and average order value (AOV) with various breakdowns.

## Features
- **Total Metrics**: Displays Total Amount (438K), Total Profit (37K), Total Quantity (5615), and Total AOV (121K).
- **Visualizations**:
  - Total Amount by State (e.g., Maharashtra, Uttar Pradesh).
  - Total Quantity by Category (pie chart).
  - Profit by Month (bar chart).
  - Total Amount by Customer Name (bar chart).
  - Total Quantity by Payment Method (pie chart).
  - Total Profit by Sub-Category (bar chart).
- **Filters**: Allows filtering by Quarter and State.

## Usage
1. Open the `.pbix` file in Power BI Desktop.
2. Connect to the data source if not embedded.
3. Use the filters on the dashboard to explore the data.
4. Save and publish to Power BI Service if needed.

## Data Source
